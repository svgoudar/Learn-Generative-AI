    "## Re-Ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "**Re-ranking** is the process of improving retrieval quality by **reordering an initial set of candidate results** using a more accurate (but more expensive) model after a fast retrieval stage.\n",
    "It is a core component of modern **RAG, search engines, and recommendation systems**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Fast retrieval methods (BM25, vector search) optimize for speed, not precision.\n",
    "Re-ranking trades additional computation for **higher answer quality** on a much smaller candidate set.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Retrieve broadly → then rank precisely.**\n",
