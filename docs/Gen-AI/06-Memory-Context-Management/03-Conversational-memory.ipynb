    "## Conversational Memory \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Definition and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conversational Memory** is the mechanism by which a Generative AI system stores, retrieves, and utilizes information from past interactions to maintain **contextual continuity**, **personalization**, and **task coherence** across turns or sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without memory, each model response is stateless and myopic:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User: My name is Sanjeev.\n",
    "User (later): What is my name?\n",
    "Model (no memory): I don't know.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With conversational memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Model: Your name is Sanjeev.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This capability is essential for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Long multi-step tasks\n",
    "* Personal assistants\n",
    "* Tutoring systems\n",
    "* Agents and copilots\n",
    "* Workflow automation\n",

    "### 2. Conceptual Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversational memory is a **context management layer** sitting outside the neural model.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Input → Memory Manager → Prompt Constructor → LLM → Response\n",
    "                          ↑\n",
    "                   Memory Store\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM itself remains **stateless**; memory is implemented at the **system layer**.\n",

    "### Step 2 — Memory Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory is saved into:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vector store (for semantic retrieval)\n",
    "* Key-value database (for structured facts)\n",
    "* Relational DB (for profiles)\n",

    "* Rule-based triggers\n",
    "* User identifiers\n",

    "Retrieved memory is injected into the model prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "System: User is a machine learning researcher working on recommender systems.\n",
    "```\n",
