    "## ReAct Prompting (Reason + Act)\n",
    "\n",
    "**ReAct** is a prompting framework that interleaves **reasoning** with **actions** (tool use) so that a model can **think, decide, and interact with external systems** while solving complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a foundation of modern **agentic AI systems**.\n",

    "Humans solve complex problems by:\n",
