    "# **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** is a prompting technique that encourages a language model to generate **explicit intermediate reasoning steps** before producing the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It significantly improves performance on tasks that require **multi-step reasoning**.\n",

    "## **1. Core Intuition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex problems are easier to solve when broken into smaller steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain-of-thought makes the model **think step by step**, rather than jumping directly to the answer.\n",

    "Q: If John has 3 apples and buys 2 more, how many does he have?\n",
