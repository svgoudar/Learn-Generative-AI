    "### 1. Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt Lifecycle Management (PLM)** is the systematic process of **designing, testing, versioning, deploying, monitoring, and continuously improving prompts** used to control the behavior of large language models (LLMs) in production systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "It treats prompts as **first-class software artifacts**.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Why PLM Is Necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "Without lifecycle management, prompts become:\n",

    "* brittle\n",
    "* inconsistent\n",
    "* untraceable\n",
    "* impossible to improve safely\n",
