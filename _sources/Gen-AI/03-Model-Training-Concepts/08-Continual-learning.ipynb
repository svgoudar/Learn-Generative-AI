    "\n",
    "**Continual Learning** is the ability of a model to **learn new tasks or knowledge over time** without forgetting previously learned information.\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows AI systems to evolve continuously instead of being retrained from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans do not forget how to ride a bicycle when they learn to drive a car.\n",

    "\n",
    "When neural networks learn new data, they tend to **overwrite old knowledge**.\n",

    "##### 2. Replay-Based\n",
    "\n",
    "Store old samples and replay them during new training.\n",
