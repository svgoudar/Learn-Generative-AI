    "## Chunking and Chunk Overlap\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chunking** is the process of splitting large documents into smaller, manageable pieces (**chunks**) before embedding, indexing, and retrieval.\n",
    "**Chunk overlap** ensures continuity of meaning across chunk boundaries by sharing content between adjacent chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both are critical design choices in **RAG systems, semantic search, and document QA pipelines**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### Core Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs and embedding models have context limits and perform best on focused inputs.\n",
