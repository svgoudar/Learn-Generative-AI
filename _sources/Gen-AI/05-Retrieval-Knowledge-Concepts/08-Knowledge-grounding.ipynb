    "## Knowledge Grounding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Knowledge grounding** is the process of anchoring a model’s generated output in **verifiable external information** so that responses are **accurate, factual, and traceable** rather than purely probabilistic guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a core reliability mechanism in **RAG, enterprise AI, legal/medical assistants, and decision-support systems**.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Core Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are excellent at language but unreliable at facts when operating only from internal parameters.\n",
    "Knowledge grounding forces the model to **look up facts before speaking**.\n",
    "\n",
