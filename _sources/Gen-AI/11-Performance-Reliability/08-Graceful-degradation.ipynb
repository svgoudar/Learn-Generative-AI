    "### 1. Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graceful Degradation** is the property of a Generative AI system to **maintain acceptable, useful behavior as conditions worsen**, rather than failing abruptly or producing unsafe / meaningless outputs.\n",

    "> When the system cannot perform optimally, it **degrades its capabilities smoothly and predictably**.\n",
