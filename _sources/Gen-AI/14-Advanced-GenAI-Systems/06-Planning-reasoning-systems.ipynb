    "Modern Generative AI systems are no longer passive text generators; they are **goal-driven decision-making agents**.\n",
    "\n",
    "They must:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand a **goal**\n",
    "* **Decompose** it into steps\n",
    "* **Reason** over constraints\n",
    "* **Plan** actions\n",
    "* **Execute**, observe results, and **adapt**\n",
    "\n",
    "This transforms LLMs into **cognitive engines** that combine *reasoning* and *planning*.\n",
