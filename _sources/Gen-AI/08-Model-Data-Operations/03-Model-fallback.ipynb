    "\n",
    "### 1. Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Fallback** is an architectural strategy in machine learning systems where multiple models are arranged in a priority order, and control is transferred to an alternative model whenever the primary model fails to meet required constraints such as **accuracy, latency, availability, cost, or safety**.\n",
    "\n",

    "\\text{Primary Model} ;\\rightarrow; \\text{Fallback Model}_1 ;\\rightarrow; \\text{Fallback Model}_2 ;\\rightarrow; \\dots\n",
    "]\n",

    "This guarantees **robustness, reliability, and service continuity**.\n",
