    "\n",
    "### 1. Motivation and Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models (LLMs) operate under a **fixed context window**.\n",
    "They cannot retain all past interactions indefinitely.\n",
    "**Summarization Memory** solves this by:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Compressing long interaction histories into compact semantic summaries that preserve essential information while discarding irrelevant details.\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Long-running conversations\n",
    "* Multi-session task continuity\n",
    "* Reduced token cost\n",
    "* Improved reasoning consistency\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Conceptual Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summarization Memory** is a memory mechanism that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accumulates conversation or document history.\n",
    "2. Periodically **summarizes** it using an LLM.\n",
    "3. Stores the summary as the new long-term context.\n",
    "4. Appends only the most recent interactions verbatim.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally:\n",

    "[\n",
    "M_t = \\text{Summarize}(M_{t-1} + I_t)\n",
    "]\n",

    "Where:\n",

    "* ( M_t ) = memory state at time ( t )\n",
